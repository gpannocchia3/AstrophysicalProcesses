\chapter{Accretion in binary systems} \label{ch:vii}
\section{Introduction}
Binary systems of stars (or black holes, as we'll see in the next chapter) are one of the most common configurations were we take a good look at the sky (that is, assuming we're able to indeed resolve the binary system).
\par On top of that, differently from their single counterpart, binaries reveal more about themselves, notably their masses and dimensions, than do other astronomical objects; this is particularly true in the case of \emph{eclipsing binaries}.
\par It may come as no surprise hearing that angular momentum is going to play a major role in the study of accretion in binary systems. For example, in many cases, the transferred material cannot land on the accreting star until it has rid itself of most of its angular momentum, leading to the formation of \emph{accretion disks}, which we'll be the focus of quite a few sections among the following.
\section{Interacting binaries}
As always, I'm referring to \cite{Frank_King_Raine_2002} for this part.
\par There are two main reasons many binaries transfer matter at some stage of their
evolutionary lifetimes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (i) one of the stars in a binary system may increase in radius (for example because it's entering the \emph{giant phase} of its evolution), or the binary separation shrink (this will be treated more carefully in the last chapter of this notes), to the point where the gravitational pull of the companion can remove the outer layers of its envelope;
    \item (ii) one of the stars may eject much of its mass in the form of a stellar wind (again, perhaps because its a particularly massive giant star); some of this material will be captured gravitationally by the companion.
\end{itemize}
We'll focus on the (i) scenario.
\section{Roche lobes}
We shall now try to understand what is it of a small test particle living in the combined gravitational potential of the two stars that make the binary, orbiting each other under the influence of their mutual gravitational attractions. The two bodies of the binary are assumed to be so massive (in respect to the test particle) that the test particle has no influence over their orbits.
\par Assuming this to hold, the system is pretty much reduced to a Physics 1 problem of two bodies interacting with a radial potential. So we already know the solution. The two stars execute Kepler orbits around each other in a plane.
\par As a further simplification, we'll assume these orbits to be circular. This is usually a good approximation for binary systems, since tidal effects tend to circularize originally eccentric orbits on timescales short compared to the time over which mass transfer occurs.
\input{chapters/binary}
\par Consider a binary system as crudely depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:binaries}. For the purposes of this section, we're going to assume that the two stars of the binary can be assumed to be point-like sources of potential with separation $a$.
\par That being said, the binary period\footnote{Here we're using the angular frequency rather than the period. It's the same up to some power of $2\pi$.} is inferred from Kepler's third law
\begin{equation}
    \Omega^{2} = \frac{G(m_{1}+m_{2})}{a^{2}}
    \label{eq:kepler_3}
\end{equation}
A more aesthetically pleasing version of Fig.\ref{fig:binaries} is given below.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/binary_pleasing.png}
    \caption{A binary system of two stars orbiting around their common center of mass. Credits: Frank, King and Raine.}
    \label{fig:bin_aesth}
\end{figure}
\par In the corotating frame, the potential generated from the system is 
\begin{equation*}
    \phi(\vec{r}\,) = -\frac{Gm_{1}}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r}_{1}|} - \frac{Gm_{2}}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r}_{2}|} -\frac{1}{2}(\vec{\Omega}\wedge\vec{r}\,)^{2}
\end{equation*}
where $\vec{r_{1}}$, $\vec{r_{2}}$ are the position vectors of the centres of the two stars.
\par It's clear that any gas flow between the two stars we should be able to describe, in principle, through Euler's equation, which will be of the form
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t} + (\vec{v}\cdot\nabla)\cdot \vec{v} = -\frac{\nabla p}{\rho}-\nabla\phi -2\vec{\Omega}\wedge\vec{v}
\end{equation*}
\par Considerable insight about accretion problems can be gained if we consider the equipotential surfaces of the the gravitational potential, and in particular their section on the orbital plane.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/roche.png}
    \caption{Sections in the orbital plane of the Roche potential $\phi$. The five Lagrange point where the potential is zero are marked in the picture with a $L_{i}$. The saddle point $L_{1}$ is said "inner Lagrange point" and forms a "pass" from the two Roche lobes (\textbf{3}). Credits: Frank, King and Raine.}
    \label{fig:roche}
\end{figure}
\par What if one of the two stars external layer bloates up and steps out of its Roche lobe? Since the lobes are essentially demarcation lines between the two (single star) potentials, once a Roche lobe is overflown, material will fall on the other object, captured by the gravitational potential of the other star.
\par This type of mass transfer is called \emph{Roche lobe overflow}. Since mass is removed from the star quite readily when the lobe is filled, the star cannot never grow significantly larger than its Roche lobe\footnote{Clearly, this only applies to binary systems whose Roche lobes are smaller than the radius of the object after its expansion.}. The star losing mass is typically named \emph{donor}, while the one gaining mass is called \emph{accretor}.
\par Generally, there's a non-zero pressure gradient near the $L_{1}$ Lagrange point, with material often flowing at supersonic speeds\footnote{For those who may be interested in the subject, I do suggest reading into something of I. S. Shklovskii, for example \cite{1972SvA....15..886S} or \href{https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu}{here}.}. Clearly, if we introduce angular momentum back into the picture, Coriolis' forces will arise, deviating the trajectory of said gas until it settles into a ring.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/disk_form.png}
    \caption{Perspective view of the spiraling gas. Credits: Frank, King and Raine.}
    \label{fig:spiral_gas}
\end{figure}
\par To a good approximation we can take the stream trajectory as the orbit of a test particle released from rest at $L_{1}$, and thus with a given angular momentum, falling in the gravitational field of the accreter alone. This would give an elliptical orbit lying in the binary plane: The presence of the donor causes this to precess slowly. A continuous stream trying to follow this orbit will therefore intersect itself, resulting in dissipation of energy via shocks.
\par On the other hand, the gas has little opportunity to rid itself of the angular momentum it had on leaving $L_{1}$, so it will tend to the orbit of lowest energy for a given angular momentum, a circular orbit. We thus expect the gas initially to orbit the accretor in the binary plane at a radius $R_{c}$ such that the Kepler orbit at $R_{c}$ has the same specific angular momentum as the transferring gas had on passing through $L_{1}$.
\par If we consider Euler's equation for the vorticity in presence of viscosity
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\text{D}\vec{\omega}}{\text{D}t} = \nu \nabla^{2}\vec{\omega}
\end{equation*}
we discover that a sensible solution may be of the form 
\begin{equation*}
    \omega \propto \exp\left(-\frac{r^{2}}{2\nu\tau}\right)
\end{equation*}
so that material diffuses all over until eventually forms a \emph{disk}, which will be the focus of the next section.
\subsection*{AGNs and BEBs (Big Energetic Bros)}
Jokes aside, as we'll have the pleasure to discuss in the next few sections, accretion is not limited only to "small" objects with hard boundaries\footnote{The notion of "hard" for something made of hot plasma may be somewhat deceptive, but we'll stick with the notation.} like stars.
\par As far as our understanding goes, the very things at the center of galaxies are constantly accreting the nearby matter, thus depleting gravitational energy in (often) spectacular forms which we're able to detect! On top of that, we're aware of the existence of binary systems made of a "small" black holes and something else; this is the case, for example of the Sco-X1 binary system.
\par AGNs (\emph{Active Galactic Nucleus}) are particularly relevant in the picture of accretion since they've been observed to be able to accrete both spherically (no angular momentum) and non-spherically (non-zero angular momentum), with the formation of a disk. Our common understanding of AGNs relies on the (fairly tested) belif that they're powered by supermassive black holes in the range of $10^{5}-10^{8}\,M_{\odot}$.
\par To give the world the illusion that we're really understanding what's going on in there, AGNs have been given a nice classification based on the type of galaxy they're found in and on their spectral features (when needed):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Blazers $\to$ Elliptical galaxies
    \item Type I Seyfert $\to$ (Late type) Spiral Galaxies with narrow absorption lines
    \item Type II Seyfert $\to$ (Late type) Spiral Galaxies with broad absorption lines\footnote{The broadness or narrowness of the lines is related to their velocity in respect to us. Narrow absorption lines mean that the AGN is far from us, while broad absorption lines are typical of closer AGNs.}
    \item Radio Loud Quasars $\to$ (Early type) Elliptical galaxies
    \item Radio Quiet Quasars $\to$ (Early type) Elliptical galaxies
\end{itemize}
\par It may be worth pointing out that this classification is pretty much a hand-wavingly way to present the same object from different points of view. In fact, all points in the previous list represent pretty much the same objects, with the relative tilt from the observation direction the only thing that is really changing. But this should not surprise you. Relativistic beaming is heavily frequency-dependent and direction-dependent, so, depending on the direction you're looking from, you're going to have really different results.
\par As you can easily cross-check in your favorite book of electrodynamics (for example \cite{Jackson:100964}), the angular distribution of radiation emitted by an accelerated charge can be calculated starting from the relativistic-adjusted Poynting's vector.
\par Doing this, you'll find out that when the velocity and the acceleration of the emitting particle are parallel, the emitted power per solid angle is given by 
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\text{d}P}{\text{d}\Omega} = \frac{e^{2}\dot{v}^{2}}{4\pi c^{3}}\frac{\sin^{2}\theta}{(1-\beta\cos\theta)^{5}}
\end{equation*}
where $\theta$ is the angle of observation measured from the direction of $\vec{\beta}$. From this expression it's clear the heavy direction-dependence; to find the frequency spectrum you need to put in some more work.
\par Although not entirely nor strictly related to this, I think you can get an idea of what's going on by watching \href{https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RCSNL0lop8I}{this short clip} by Kip Thorne.
\par Another interesting fact is that most of these systems present powerful jets which may remain coherent for \emph{kiloparsecs}.
\par How? Now, that's a good question. The most accredited theory has been developed by R. D. Blandford and R. L. Znajek in 1977 \cite{1977MNRAS.179..433B}; we won't go much deeper than this here\footnote{To quote a book I've studied from: "The author of this notes does not claim to have any particular insight on the subject."} but they have essentially speculated the formation of magnetic funnels around spinning black holes.
\par When you start considering spinning black holes, a whole other handful of problems arises. For once, you can no longer use the nice and simple Schwarzschild metric to describe the BH, but you have to use Kerr's. Even then, it has been shown that in presence of Kerr's black holes, if the accretion disk is (somehow) tilted in respect to the rotation axis of the BH, an effect called \emph{Bardeen precession} \cite{1975ApJ...195L..65B} arises, leading to a considerable part of the radiation emitted in the central part of the disk to be reabsorbed, inducing observable changes in the X-ray spectrum.
\par And then you have curious fellas like \emph{obscure black holes}, which are essentially geometrically thick (we'll see more about this in the next section) tori through which only infrared radiation may pass. 
\section{Disk formation}
If we ignore for the time being viscosity in Euler's equation, we may write
\begin{equation*}
    \partial_{t}\vec{v} + (\vec{v}\cdot \nabla)\cdot \vec{v} = -\frac{\nabla p}{\rho} -\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\hat{r}
\end{equation*}
Assuming ideal gas behavior
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p = \frac{RT}{\mu}\nabla\,(\log(p))
\end{equation*}
\par For convenience's sake, we're going to switch to adimensional coordinates
\begin{equation*}
    \tilde{r} = r/r_{0} \quad \tilde{v} = v/\Omega_{0}r_{0} \quad \tilde{t} = \Omega_{0}t \implies \tilde{\nabla} = r_{0}\nabla
\end{equation*}
this way Euler's equation can be restated in terms of adimensional quantities only. Introducing once again the Virial temperature (\ref{eq:virial_temperature})
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial \tilde{t}} + (\tilde{v}\cdot \tilde{\nabla})\cdot \tilde{v} = -\frac{T}{T_{vir}}\tilde{\nabla}\log(p)-\frac{1}{\tilde{r}^{2}}\hat{r}
\end{equation*}
\par From this last equation we're learning something important already: If $T \ll T_{vir}$ there's no feedback from the gas, and so the disk's geometry will be determined by gravity alone.
\par Assuming that there's little pressure pushing on the "vertical" direction, we may deduce that the vertical size will be "geometrically thin", and its dynamic will be dominated by gravity alone. In fact, at first order, the vertical component of the acceleration can be assumed to be
\begin{equation*}
    g_{z} = -\Omega_{0}^{2}z
\end{equation*}
which gives raise to a non-negligible velocity dispersion along the vertical direction. In short: Particles start oscillating.
\par Although we'd be contradicting ourselves, we're going to assume hydrostatic equilibrium to hold along the vertical direction. This allows us to find an analytic expression for the density profile along the vertical axis 
\begin{equation*}
    \rho(z) = \rho_{0}\exp\left(-\frac{z^{2}}{2H^{2}}\right)
\end{equation*}
with $H = c_{s}/\Omega_{0}$ the disk's scale height and $c_{s} = (TR/\mu)^{1/2}$ the sound speed. If we define the \emph{aspect ratio} $\delta$ of the disk as 
\begin{equation}
    \delta = \frac{H}{r} = \frac{c_{s}}{Hr} = \left(\frac{T}{T_{vir}}\right)^{1/2}= \frac{1}{M} < 1
    \label{eq:aspect_ratio}
\end{equation}
we conclude that the gas in the disk must be supersonic\footnote{For $\Omega_{0}r$ can be considered the tangential velocity to the (circular) orbit.}. Thus, the disk is pretty much a continuum of Keplerian orbits along which the gas has different velocities.
\par Now, if we move to the comoving frame and recall Fig.\ref{fig:stratified_fluid}, we may notice that we are in the exact conditions for shear instability to arise. But since angular momentum is \emph{fixed} for any given orbit, each displacement caused by shear instabilities will be simply ignored, for angular momentum conservation will eventually bring back the displaced element to its original position.
\par In fact, as long as 
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial J}{\partial r} < 0
\end{equation*}
the disk is stable against small element-displacement.
\par If that's the case, how can accretion be possible? Viscosity.
\par Although we have no clues (sorta\footnote{As for many other things in the Universe, it is probably turbulence's doing. We'll take a look at it in the next section.}\,) of how the viscosity gets high enough to allow the rings of gas to migrate towards the center and lose angular momentum, it's clear that if that is the case, then accretion may indeed be possible.
\section{The Shakura-Sunyaev model}
As we have mentioned \emph{en passant} at the end of the last section, in a differentially rotating medium (like our Keplerian-continuum) must develope tangential stresses between adjacent layers, which are usually belived to be connected to the presence of magnetic fields, turbulence and molecular and/or radiative viscosity as the primary mechanisms of transport of angular momentum.
\par In the conditions that are of interest to us, nor molecular nor radiative viscosity can be able to lead to accretion. So that leaves us with only magnetic fields and turbulence. As noticed by Shakura and Sunyaev \cite{1973A&A....24..337S}, the magnetic field flowing into the disk may have a regular structure at the distances comparable to the outer radius of the disk. But since $\nabla\cdot\vec{H} = 0$, the radial component of the magnetic field must have alternating sign, hence differential rotation leads to division of the large magnetic loops into smaller ones.
\par Within the disk is then most probable for the field to be chaotic and on the small scales. The energy density in the magnetic field cannot possibly exceed the thermal energy of matter 
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\left\|\vec{H}\right\|^{2}}{8\pi} < \rho\frac{c_{s}^{2}}{2}
\end{equation*}
Although we have no complete theory of turbulence, we have observational checks of its existence in accretion disks, so we can assume turbulence to be indeed present.
\par In fact, as computed by \cite{Frank_King_Raine_2002} (§4.7), a safe estimate of the Reyndolds' number evaluates roughly at $\text{Re} > 10^{14}$. Hence, molecular viscosity is far too weak to bring about the viscous dissipation and angular momentum transport we require. We may then conjecture that the gas flow in accretion discs is also turbulent, although there is, as yet, no proof that this is so.
\par Although we know pretty much nothing, we can still make some sensible claims on the quantities limiting the onset of turbulence: First, the typical size of the largest turbulent eddies cannot exceed the disc thickness $H$; second, it is unlikely that the turnover velocity $v_{turb}$ is supersonic, for, in this case, the turbulent motions would probably be thermalized by shocks. Thus, we can write 
\begin{equation}
    \nu = \alpha c_{s}H 
    \label{eq:alpha_presc}
\end{equation}
and can probably expect with a certain degree of confidence that $\alpha$ will turn out to be less than 1.
\par Another way to see this is by considering two adjacent elements of the disk that are going to generate eddies of, say, size $l$. The stress tensor $\sigma$ is going to be roughly equal to 
\begin{equation*}
    \sigma \sim r\partial_{r}\Omega \sim -\frac{3}{2}\Omega \implies v \sim \sigma l
\end{equation*}
\par Since the velocity of the gas can't get as high as being causality-breaking, $v_{max}\sim c_{s}$. Hence
\begin{equation*}
    l \sim \frac{c_{s}}{\sigma} \sim H \implies \nu \sim H^{2}\Omega \sim \implies \alpha \sim 1
\end{equation*}
\par This is the celebrated \emph{Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$-prescription}. Note how this is but a mere parametrization: We have simply dumped everything we don't know about turbulence in the $\alpha$ parameter and then adjusted the remaining quantities on the basis of dimensional analysis only.
\subsection{The structure of the disk}
Let's assume the accretion disk to be geometrically thin (along the vertical axis) with cylindrical symmetry. All calculations will be carried out with Newtonian mechanics. It is necessary to take into account GR corrections only in the region $r<3R_{s}$, where no stable circular orbits are possible\footnote{You can see \cite{carroll} §5, for more details.}.
\par We can define the surface density of the disk $\Sigma(r)$ as 
\begin{equation}
    \Sigma(r) = -\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \rho(z,r)\,\text{d}z \approx 2H\rho_{0}
\end{equation}
with $\rho_{0}$ the density on the plane of the disk\footnote{We have plugged in the $\rho(z)$ behavior we have hand-wavingly pulled out of the cylinder in the last section.}.
\par We shall now consider the conservation equations 
\begin{align}
    \partial_{t}(r\Sigma) + \partial_{r}(r\Sigma v_{r}) &= 0\\
    v_{\phi}^{2} &= \frac{GM}{r}
    \label{eq:cons_sh-su}
\end{align}
while the equation of conservation of angular momentum will be 
\begin{equation}
    \partial_{t}(v_{\phi}\rho) + v_{r}\partial_{r}(\rho v_{\phi}) = F_{\phi}
\end{equation}
with $F_{\phi}$ the viscous "forces". Integrating over the vertical direction yields 
\begin{equation}
    \partial_{t}(r\Sigma\Omega r^{2}) + \partial_{r}(r\Sigma v_{r}\Omega r^{2}) = \partial_{r}(S r^{3}\partial_{r}\Omega)
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation*}
    S = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \rho\nu\,\text{d}z \approx \Sigma \nu
\end{equation*}
if we assume $\nu$ weakly dependent on $z$. Under the assumption of a \emph{isothermal disk} $\alpha \neq \alpha(z),\,\Omega \propto r^{-3/2}$ we obtain the \emph{thin disk equation}
\begin{equation}
    r\partial_{t}\Sigma = 3\partial_{r}\left(r^{1/2}\partial_{r}\left(\nu \Sigma r^{1/2}\right)\right)
    \label{eq:thin_disk}
\end{equation}
This is the basic equation governing the time evolution of surface density in a Keplerian disc. In general, it is a nonlinear diffusion equation for $\Sigma$, because $\nu$ may be a function of local variables in the disc.
\par Given a solution of this equation, we can backtrack and find a solution for $v_{r}$, which will simply be 
\begin{equation*}
    v_{r} = -\frac{3}{\Sigma r^{1/2}}\partial_{r}\left(\nu\Sigma r^{1/2}\right)
\end{equation*}
Clearly, to make further progress we need some prescription for $\nu$.
\par Let's see what happens if we allow the disk to settle into a steady-state structure and set all $\partial_{t} = 0$ in the conservation equations. From here it's clear that the mass transfer rate $\dot{M}$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
    \dot{M} = -2\pi\Sigma |v_{r}| r \quad (v_{r}<0)
\end{equation*}
which is also equal to 
\begin{equation*}
    \dot{M} = 6\pi r^{1/2} \partial_{r}\left(\nu\Sigma r^{1/2}\right)
\end{equation*}
by means of substituting the backtracked value of $v_{r}$ we've written down a few lines above. From the conservation of angular momentum we get 
\begin{equation*}
    -\nu\Sigma r^{3}\partial_{r}\Omega = -|v_{r}|\Sigma\Omega r^{3} + C
\end{equation*}
with $C$ an arbitrary constant of integration, related to the rate at which angular momentum flows into the compact star, or equivalently, the couple exerted by the star on the inner edge of the disc.
\par If the system is stationary, all the properties of the disk are determined by the (constant) accretion rate alone 
\begin{equation}
    \nu\Sigma = \frac{1}{3\pi}\dot{M}\left(1-\beta\left(\frac{R_{*}}{r}\right)^{1/2}\right)
    \label{eq:stationary_viscosity}
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ is an integration constant and $R_{*}$ is the inner radius of the disk. From here we deduce that the flux of angular momentum going in the accretor is 
\begin{equation*}
    F_{J} = -\dot{M}\beta\Omega_{Kepl}(R_{*})R_{*}^{2}
\end{equation*}
\par For example, let us suppose that the disc extends all the way down to the surface $r = R_{*}$ of the central star\footnote{As we already mentioned, this can't be the case if the central object is a BH. The minimum radius permitted in that case is that of the ISCO, the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit predicted by Schwarzschild.}. Hence, there must exist a radius $\tilde{R} > R_{*}$ where $\partial_{r}\Omega = 0$. In a realistic situation, the star must rotate more slowly than break-up speed at its equator
\begin{equation*}
    \Omega(R_{*}) < \Omega_{Kepl}(R_{*})
\end{equation*}
this implies $\beta = 1$. This means there will be an inward flux of angular momentum; accretion is therefore going to speed up the rotation of the central object. 
\subsection{Stochastic background of GW}
This is in particular the case of objects commonly known as "recycled pulsars".
\par These objects are thought to be related to low-mass X-ray binary systems. It is speculated that X-rays emissions in these systems are generated by the accretion disk of a neutron star. The transfer of angular momentum from this accretion event can increase the rotation rate of the pulsar to hundreds of times per second, as is observed in millisecond pulsars.
\par This category of object is particularly relevant because of their extreme regularity: They have very short periods (typically of the order of the millisecond) with very low rate of change in time\footnote{The interested reader can refer, for example, to \cite{1991ApJ...366..501D}.}. As such, it has become customary to use such pulsars to "build" a PTA (\emph{Pulsar Timing Array}\footnote{Basically, a set of galactic pulsars that is monitored and analyzed to search for correlated signatures in the pulse arrival times on Earth.}) in order to detect correlations of the pulses of the pulsars due to the transit of a gravitational wave.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/gwb.svg.png}
    \caption{Plot of the correlations observed by NANOGrav (2023) vs angular separation between pulsars, compared with a theoretical model (dashed purple) and if there were no gravitational wave background (solid green) Credits: Wikipedia.}
    \label{fig:gwb}
\end{figure}
\par This is particularly true when the wavelength of the GW is comparable with the relative distance between the pulsars.
\par This way, it has been possible to gather evidence of a stochastic background of GW, as depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:gwb} and predicted by Hellings and Downs in 1983 \cite{1983ApJ...265L..39H}.
\section{Spectrum and temperature of the disk}
\par Consider again eq.\ref{eq:stationary_viscosity} for $\Omega_{*}<\Omega_{Kepl}$, so that $\beta = 1$. Under the assumption of LTE, we'd like to see if we're able to determinate the surface temeprature of the disk. You should recall the 1st principle of Thermodynamics
\begin{equation*}
    \rho T \frac{\text{d}S}{\text{d}t} = -\nabla\cdot\vec{F}_{H}+Q_{\nu}
\end{equation*}
On the left hand side we have the variation of entropy, while on the right hand side we have the heat flux and viscous dissipation\footnote{As in stars, the vertical energy transport mechanism may be either radiative or convective, depending on whether or not the temperature gradient required for radiative transport is smaller or greater than the gradient given by the adiabatic assumption. See Chapter \ref{ch:iv}, §4.4.}. If we consider almost stationary processes, the dissipation must happen over a timescale roughly equal to the orbital period $t_{D}\sim\Omega^{-1}$. Hence 
\begin{equation*}
     \rho T \frac{\text{d}S}{\text{d}t} \approx 0 \;\text{for}\; t>t_{D}
\end{equation*}
Note that this condition is automatically satisfied if LTE holds, since it assures energetic equilirbium. This way we can integrate over the vertical direction the 1st principle above and find
\begin{equation*}
    \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}(-\nabla\cdot\vec{F})\,\text{d}z + \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}Q_{\nu}\,\text{d}z \approx 0
\end{equation*}
Because of the thin disc approximation, the disc medium is essentially "plane-parallel" at each radius, so that the temperature gradient is effectively in the $z$-direction; thus, the left hand side is simply equal to 2 times $F(z)$ (up to an additive constant).
\par Assuming that the disc is optically thick in the $z$-direction holds as a consequence that each element of the disc face radiates roughly as a blackbody with a temperature $T(r)$ given by equating the dissipation rate $D(r)$ per unit face area to the blackbody flux (\ref{SB})
\begin{equation*}
    \sigma T_{s}^{4} = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}Q_{\nu}\,\text{d}z = D(r)
\end{equation*}
\par What this equation is saying is just that all energy dissipated by viscosity is radiated away. At this point we may write down the 8 equations for the disk structure, but, in the interest of time, I won't. The interested reader may refer, once again, to \cite{Frank_King_Raine_2002}, §5.4, equation(s) 5.41.
\par If we evaluate the dissipation rate 
\begin{equation*}
    D(r) = \frac{G\partial_{r}\Omega}{4\pi r} = \frac{1}{2}\nu\Sigma(r\partial_{r}\Omega)^{2}
\end{equation*}
If we consider where the angular frequency has the Keplerian form
\begin{equation*}
    D(r) = \frac{9}{8}\nu\Sigma\frac{GM}{r^{3}} = \frac{9}{8}\nu\Sigma\Omega^{2}
\end{equation*}
At this point we can equate the blackbody flux with the viscous dissipation and, plugging in the result from eq.\ref{eq:stationary_viscosity}, we finally obtain
\begin{equation}
    \sigma T(r)^{4} =  \frac{3}{8\pi}\dot{M}\frac{GM}{r^{3}}\left(1-\left(\frac{R_{*}}{r}\right)^{1/2}\right)
    \label{eq:disk_surface_temp}
\end{equation}
which is notably independent from viscosity.
\par Far from the inner radius of the disk $r \gg R_{*}$, the surface temperature of the disk can be expressed as 
\begin{equation*}
    T(r) = T_{*}\left(\frac{r}{R_{*}}\right)^{-3/4} \quad T_{*} = \left(\frac{3GM\dot{M}}{8\pi\sigma R_{*}^{3}}\right)^{1/4}
\end{equation*}
with $T_{*}$ curiously of the same order of the blackbody temperature defined as follows 
\begin{equation*}
    T_{B} = \left(\frac{L_{acc}}{4\pi\sigma R_{*}^{2}}\right)^{1/4}
\end{equation*}
that is the temperature the accreting source would have if it were to radiate the given power as a blackbody spectrum.
\par Recalling the plane parallel approximation for radiative diffusion (\ref{eq:sstr4}) with no flux coming from the outside
\begin{equation*}
    -\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}r}(\sigma T^{4}) = \frac{3}{4}F\rho\kappa_{R} \implies F = \sigma T^{4}(\tau = 2/3)\footnote{This one holds true because for a plane parallel grey atmosphere with the Eddington approximation in LTE you can show that $T^{4} = 3/4 \,T_{eff}^{4}(\tau + 2/3)$.}
\end{equation*}
hence if we assume the flux to be roughly constant along the vertical direction 
\begin{equation*}
    F = \sigma T_{s}^{4} = \sigma T(r)^{4} =  \frac{3}{8\pi}\dot{M}\frac{GM}{r^{3}}\left(1-\left(\frac{R_{*}}{r}\right)^{1/2}\right)
\end{equation*}
If we assume the opacity to be constant along the vertical direction 
\begin{equation*}
    \tau = \frac{\kappa\Sigma}{2} \gg 1 \implies T^{4} = \frac{27}{64}\sigma^{-1}\Omega^{2}\nu\Sigma^{2}\kappa
\end{equation*}
Despite this being a really bad take, it still gives us an idea of how the central temperature of the disk may depend on the viscosity.
\subsection{The structure of steady $\alpha$-disks}
The disk structure we're now investigating was, as you may have guessed from the title, proposed by Shakura and Sunyaev. All we need is a prescription for the viscosity and one for the opacity. 
\par In order to do this, we're going to assume ideal gas behavior with negligible radiation pressure, with viscosity given by the $\alpha$-prescription
\begin{equation*}
    \nu = \alpha c_{s} H
\end{equation*}
and assume that $\rho$ and $T_{c}$ (a.k.a. the central temperature) are such that the Rosseland mean opacity is well approximated by Kramers’ law\footnote{We haven't actually seen this in class, so take it at face value.}
\begin{equation*}
    \kappa_{R} = 5\cdot 10^{24} \rho T_{c}^{-7/2}\,\text{cm}^{2}\,\text{g}^{-1}
\end{equation*}
With these choices for $\nu$ and $\kappa_{R}$ the system of equations for the disk is algebraic and can be solved straightforwardly. The Shakura-Sunyaev disk solution is
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \label{fig:sha-sun_eq}
\end{figure}
A number of interesting remarks can be made just by observing these equations. First of all, in none of the equations the $\alpha$-parameter we know pretty much nothing about enters with a high power. This means that all these quantities are not particularly sensitive to the actual value of $\alpha$. Though this also means that we cannot expect to discover the typical size of $\alpha$ by direct comparison of steady-state disc theory with observations.
\par If we compute the aspect ratio $\delta$
\begin{equation}
    \delta = \frac{H}{r} = \left(\frac{R}{\mu}\right)^{2/5}\left(\frac{3}{64\pi^{2}\sigma}\right)^{1/10}\left(\frac{\kappa}{\alpha}\right)^{1/10}GM^{-7/10}r^{1/20}(f\dot{M})^{1/5}
    \label{eq:aspect_ratio_ss}
\end{equation}
so the disc is indeed thin.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{img/disk.png}
    \caption{Section (not scaled) of the disk. The weak $r$ dependence is greatly accentuated.}
    \label{fig:concave_disk}
\end{figure}
\par In agreement with this, the radial drift velocity $v_{r}$ is highly subsonic while the Kepler velocity $v_{\phi}$ is very supersonic. The disk is certainly optically thick for any reasonable accretion rate; the central and surface temperatures are in the ratio $\sim \tau^{1/4}\sim 3.7$, so the disk is roughly uniform in the vertical direction and can extend out to quite large radii, of the order of the Roche lobe of the accreting star.
\par Earlier we've computed the disspation due to viscous forces 
\begin{equation*}
    W_{\nu} = \frac{1}{2}D(r) = \frac{9}{4}\nu\Sigma\Omega^{2}
\end{equation*}
and we can compare it to the gravitational potential $W_{G}$
\begin{equation*}
    W_{G} = \frac{1}{2\pi r}\frac{GM\dot{M}}{2r^{2}}
\end{equation*}
which is defined so that 
\begin{equation*}
    \int_{R_{*}}^{\infty} 2\pi r W_{G} = \frac{GM\dot{M}}{2R_{*}}
\end{equation*}
\par Their ratio evaluates to 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{W_{\nu}}{W_{G}} = 3\left(1-\left(\frac{R_{*}}{r}\right)^{1/2}\right)
    \label{eq:energy_ratio}
\end{equation}
from which is clear that at large distances (respect to the inner radius of the disk) $W_{\nu}\approx 3 W_{G}$.
\par At a fixed distance we should then see a monochromatic intensity which is a convolution of all the blackbody radiation from that point on 
\begin{equation*}
    I_{\nu} = \int B_{\nu}(T_{s}(r))\,\text{d}r
\end{equation*}
\par A first correction would be to include radiation pressure $p = aT^{4}/3$ if it is too big to be neglected. The aspect ratio would then change 
\begin{equation*}
    \delta \approx \frac{3}{8\pi} \frac{\kappa}{cR}f\dot{M} = \frac{3}{2}f\frac{\dot{M}}{\dot{M}_{E}} \quad \dot{M}_{E} = \frac{4\pi Rc}{\kappa}
\end{equation*}
If this is the case, there's a serious "risk" of incurring into ADAF.
